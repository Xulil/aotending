# thoughts AOT Alternative ending 
Mikasa should be the one to kill Eren, though before that she should not have alternate memories with, instead she could have that same old migraine, remembering all those moments with Eren, leading up to his question. "What am I to you". Which then she is resolved to kill Eren. After she kills him, there should be no kiss, but rather a heartfelt line while line answering the question Eren had.

"You are not just my family. You are my loved. See you later, Eren."
 <!-- You are more important than that. -->

EreMika and EreHisu : I am not a shipper for them also. I don't support EreMika also.

80 percent : It should not be mentioned how many people were killed.



# Levi floch
Levi floch scene: pretty much after season 3, Levis role is pretty much flattened. Also Floch is meatriding Eren so hard, that is also pissing me off. I decided to add another scene for these two to add a little depth to them. Remember when Zeke self exploded. Floch should be the first one to find Levi. He who was in the same battlefield as Levi during Shiganshina arc asks Levi:
"Why are you doing this ? Don't you hate people from Marley who killed us Eldians?"

Levi says while slowly dying
"I don't really know... But one thing I am sure is I hate to be with someone who killed Erwin, and our comrades..."
We know that Levi valued Erwin as his true friend.

Floch understands what he meant. He was hesitating, hesitating to kill Levi. He decided to leave him.


Levi annie moment : Remember when Jean beat Reiner up. Levi should do the same to Annie, since she was the one who killed his squad and petra. Creating futher scuffle between avengers.


# Reiner and Annie parents
Optional:
Reiner and Annie : their parents must die in the process of the Rumbling along with soldiers of Marley. They understand now what it feels like to lose your loved ones. Therefore, giving them further resolve to kill Eren stop further deaths. This will create further tension between Eren and Avengers gang.

# Ymir and Eren
# music choice : eye-water
## Explanation from Eren: I am torn whether to use Armin or rather Ymir in the paths to understand Eren's motives. I decided that it would be the best to choose Ymir to understand Eren's motives.

During the climax, Eren was woken up during paths. There he sees Ymir the founding titan as a child. She approaches him, looking at him. They don't know much about each other. But one thing they do know, that they strived for freedom more than anyone. Eren asks Ymir, what has happened to her during her times. She explained that as slave she suffered more than anyone else. She had no freedom, as it has been taken away. Therefore she chose death to release herself from such cruel world. However, she didn't know that the curse continued to exist. When she found out. Her will of freedom was shattered. That is until Eren came here. 

She asks: 
"Are you going to exterminate all humans from Mailand?"

(A moment of silence)
It might be that Ymir already knows about Eren since she was watching over all eldians in the Paths
Eren replies : "Yes. I need to. In order to achieve freedom..."

Ymir : "Even if it meant to kill Armin and Mikasa?"



Eren :"Yes..."

Ymir :"Then why did you try to save Historia."
<!-- Ymir brought up Historia to the discussion. -->
Ymir somehow exposed eren from his own contradictions.
Eren :"... I guess I can't hide from you"

Eren remembers the conversation he had with Historia
CUT


# Eren and Historia
Summary :Eren and Historia: They are not in love, the reason Historia wants to have a baby is because there is nothing she could do at that moment. The only thing she could at least is to distract herself from guilt of thousands of people dying because of Paradis is to have a kid. Since she also doesn't want Paradis to be destroyed as a queen. She will mention that she has a childhood friend and she likes him. She plans to have a kid with that childhood friend. However, she knows that this doesn't excuse her of being one of the reasons Rumbling is going to happen and many people are going to die , therefore says "I am really the worst girl, the world's enemy" to which Eren agrees. However, at the end of conversation Eren has a last favor/wish for to do. 

<!-- Eren : "Annie will soon wake up from the sleep. Eventually the Yeagerists will know about this. If the plan with Zeke didnt' go well, they will make you inherit the powers of Female Titan. It is best of you to stay away from this." -->

Historia :"How can I stay away from this? If I don't stop from you now, you will kill everyone during Rumbling"

Eren: "Yes, I will"

Historia: "Then I can't. If I don't stop you right I won't be able to apologize to Ymir."
(after a moment of silence)
Eren : "You won't"

Historia : "huh?"

Eren : "You won't be able to apologize to her anymore!"

after a sudden realization of Ymir's death Historia was deeply saddened, tears started flowing. 
...

Eren : "Do you understand now? I want you to be silent this time. I don't want you to be involved in this."
Historia  while having tears: "Why !? Why would you do this, Eren?" 
Eren: "Because you are the worst girl that saved me that day ..."

Historia started to remember all those words Ymir said.

...
...
...
... 
Historia is in deep thoughts

Historia : "What would you think of me having a child?"

Eren : "What do you mean?"
<!-- I will live with him somewhere secret. -->
Historia : "I know you won't stop even If I told you. I can't bring myself just to stay here doing nothing. I have a childhood friend of mine and I really like him. I know he feels the same. Perhaps the only thing for me to do is to have a child, a NEW LIFE that I have to raise, a child that is my new hope, a child that is free of hatred, a child that is special. This is the only way for me to continue living, to fight against such cruel world." Historia knows that she is being selfish and  utters 
<!-- "That is the only thing I could do to distract myself... " -->
"I am really the worst girl, since I might be saying this as an excuse to distract myself from the guilt..."

Eren seeing the sad expressions of Historia says:
"You really are the worst girl. But maybe that would the best option ... "
... (moment of silence)
"Historia, can I ask you one last favor..."

then CUT to other scene


Eren following Historia and Farmer: This scene could be explained that Historia was going to introduce Eren to her lover. The reason she looked sad before can be because she heard the last wish from Eren. Then she introduces Farmer to Eren. The farmer s name is Richard. Richard waves at Eren and approaches him. They will have a conversation to which Richard admits that he was one of the bullies to Historia. He was very apologetic of it, as a kid he liked Historia, but didn't realize about it. His friends were teasing him about it. But he didn't want to admit it therefore started bullying her. Later on, he realized how grave of a mistake he made, decided to find Historia, later knowing she joined scouts. He became very worried. And when he found Historia and the scouts came back from outside the wall, he hugged her, confessing all the dumb shit he did. We can also add Ymir getting jealous, yelling "What are you doing to my Krista, You fucker!! " Then the story of love started from there. Richard admits that it is such a dumb story but Eren decided to give a subtle smile saying "I am relieved. I am sure you will give her good life." Both Farmer and Eren looks at Historia, who was confused. 

Richard replies "Yeah, I will. I have done many things to hurt Historia. I realized how grave of a mistake I made. But I kept moving forward, making sure that I will make decisions that I won't regret in the future. I won't allow such mistakes again." 

(awkward silence)
Richard admits : "Haha how prententious of me even though I am not that older than you"

Eren interrupts: "No.. You are right..."
Eren genuinely valued his word, as he becomes more resolved 


---CUT---




# Back to Ymir
CUT BACK

Ymir :"Even that time, with Mikasa" Ymir mentioned the question he asked when being in Marley

Eren: "Yeah I hoped, she would run away with me. But I wasn't successful"

Ymir : "Then why did you do it, when you saw such future?" 
She is finally asking the question every viewer had for a long time

Eren now knowing he can't hide anything from Ymir, decided to confess.


# erens motives

START OF REVEAL

Eren started to reveal the secret of being The Attack Titan user
Eren's motives: Upon receiving the future memories, he also received past memories of Attack Titan users. The memories include of Eren Kruger, who killed many eldians for the greater sake to defeat Marley. Kruger wanted to see the sight of Rumbling. Perhaps Eren also wanted to see the Rumbling, ever since his mother got eaten, since his freedom got taken. After realizing he and his friends are hated outside the walls. He is disappointed. He wanted to trample everything, to finally be free, free from cycle of hatred.

END OF REVEAL


ACTUAL CONVERSATION:

"That moment when I saw the future, I also inherited the memories and emotions of all past Attack titan users"
"As Marley kept oppressing the Eldians, the growing hatred of Attack Titan users started to expand"
"One of them is Eren Kruger. He had one of the strongest emotions of hatred towards Marley. If I tried to change the future, his memories and consciousness wouldn't let me"
(We can introduce his backstory if we want)

Eren started gazing at the sky and slowly remembering the day when Titans broke shiganshina wall. Then he uttered

"Or perhaps I wanted it myself...
Ever since that day, when my mother died...
"
"Being caged inside the wall, I always wanted to be free. "
"I wanted to see the sea that me and Armin saw in the book. Instead, we only got hatred. A chain of hatred."
"After knowing the truth, I was disappointed..."

so admited Eren



Ymir : "Let me ask you again, are you going to kill your friends?"
But when Ymir asked again Eren whether he is going to Armin and Mikasa to achieve his goal, we see his emotional struggle. He is really in dilemma but eventually saying while tearing up.

Eren: "I don't want to, I don't wish to sacrifice any more of my friends. I just want to put full stop of it..." He is saying this because he knows Sasha already died because of him. 

Ymir smiled and uttered: "I'm glad."

Then we cut to the scene where the fight is going on. Momentarily all Titans stop moving forward. This is once in a lifetime opening. Levi commanded Mikasa to utilize this opening to end the tragedy. She who is already resolved, decided to end all of this. 

CUT Mikasa Eren scene 


# Mikasa kills Eren
Mikasa should be the one to kill Eren, though before that she should not have alternate memories with, instead she could have that same old migraine, remembering all those moments with Eren, leading up to his question. "What am I to you". Which then she is resolved to kill Eren. After she kills him, there should be no kiss, but rather a heartfelt line while answering the question Eren had.

Mikasa :"You are not just my family. You are my loved. See you later, Eren."

# Eren and his mother
Eren killing his mother: this section should be completely removed, cause it makes no sense...


# Eren Death 
Eren Death: after Eren died, we see Mikasa hugging his head, to which Armin also comes while feeling sad about his death. Armin says "You have gone too far, idiot." Jean, Connie, Levi also has sad complicated emotions. Annie and Reiner were heading towards their parents corpse, mourning for them. Too many things, too many emotions, they all don't know what to do anymore.




# Historia 



Historia part : The next day after giving birth to the child. Guards wanted to check on Historia. They knocked the door but didnt hear any answer. They wen't to the room and just saw the baby and a letter. The letter said that they should take care of baby while she is away temporarily. We cut to the scene that Historia is heading somewhere wearing the military clothes. She is ultimately resolved to do something remembering what Eren had told her. We then see the ruckus that Yaegerist are making. It is chaotic and Paradis is slowly becoming a fascist state. Historia seeing this knew she had to do something. She already accepted the role of a queen as Historia. She decided to put an end to this chaos giving her queen speech starting off by "I want you all listen to me, the Queen of Paradis...". The Yeagerist won't listen to her initially as they also have power. However, Historia was once regarded as hero who saved Paradis from Reiss Titan, so a lot of civillians decided to support to her. She tried to convince them with Eren's will. Most Yeagerists are still in doubt. When things are not looking good, that's when Hitch came to help her. Claiming she is the true queen and will serve her no matter what.

(Recommended music : Zero Eclipse)


# Returning to Paradis
Armin narrating the current state of the world : Right now billions of people died because of Rumbling. Only 5% percent (or whatever percent it makes) survived this tragedy. Because of this, the world has become minority while Paradis having majority of population, therefore there won't be any retaliation from Marley and the world, since most of the infrastructure has been destroyed. Is this part of your plan too, Eren? 

Levi, Annie, Reiner and there bunch decided to stay in Marley, while only Jean, Connie, Mikasa, and me were deciding whether to head back to Paradis. We were thinking what awaits us in Paradis. Perhaps severe punishments as we killed Eren. In the end, we decided to head back anyways.

When the boat is slowly approaching to the dock. We saw Yaegerists waiting. We thought we would be detained as soon as we reach the dock. However, amidst the Yeagerists Historia was also there. We were surprised.

"What is going on? Why is Historia there?" asked Connie

"I don't fucking know!!" Replied Jean aggressively

Me and Mikasa were also curious as why she was there.

Eventually the boat reached the dock, and Historia came in front, while we got off the boat.

"Any serious injuries ???"
asked Historia

"No, not really "

(Historia smiling while looking at Armin and his bunch)

"I am glad you guys came back in good health"

Historia started explaining the situation as she gained control in current Paradis. After that, she decided to walk upfront

"Mikasa, Armin I have something to give you"

She handed over two letters to us, saying

"It is from Eren..."

Eren ?!?! What could be written in this? It might be coincidence but just now I remember me, Mikasa and Eren were playing as kids. I looked at Mikasa, thinking whether to open it now, ultimately decided to do so. 


# letter to Armin  (This letter references why Eren said he is the same as Reiner during Marley attack)

Armin. Ever since you showed me the book of outside world, I always wished for the freedom to explore it. But when I saw the future, I ultimately became disappointed. People from the world rejected the very Existence of Paradis, my beloved land. I knew I had to do something to break the cycle of hatred in order to acquire the freedom I wished for, even if it meant to kill everyone outside. However, soon I realized that I am just as cowardly as Reiner was. I couldn't imagine every single person as this will result killing you and Mikasa. Sasha, Hange and many people from Paradis have already died because of me. Even if I strived for freedom more than anyone else in this world, I became attached to you guys.  I refuse to sacrifice any more of my friends. What is the point of freedom, if all your loved ones are dead. That's why I had to make a choice. A choice that won't make me regret the most. Thank you Armin for stopping me...

Eren.


I started to tear up while yelling what kind of fucking idiot is he. Why wouldn't he talk to me about this !!?!?

However, my tears were quickly interrupted by Mikasa's cries.

She was breaking down. She cried loudly and loudly on her knees, while hugging the letter as firm as possible. It is the first time I have seen Mikasa like this. But I feel , currently, she is being the most genuine herself. Her cries were reminiscent of a baby. It's as if she s been holding up all this time. The whole mood was sad. All of us don't know what was written on her letter. But the only thing we could do is at least stay silent.

(music choices : Attack on D, Reason, ThanksAT, omake-pfadlib)
(Recommended music : Call of Silence. Because it fits the theme of the moment and is just beautiful)



# 3 years later 

before transitioning to this scene. We should show people from Paradis coming to Mainland, slowly rebuilding infrastructure and farms etc. Reason is I just want to insert Friendships OST to represent new hope. 

(Copium I know)


# Music choice : attackon D lullaby from kids , I felt its just better to have this music
# Recommended : gt20130218
Armin narrating: As the world suffered great damage, Historia lead people from Paradis into the Mainland rebuilding the infrastructure. She promised that this time the cycle won't happen again. There won't be any discrimination from now on. Although not everyone Paradis agreed with her, it would take time to accept it. But I believe as long as we fight, there will always be a hope. Isn't it right, Eren?


CUT

# Mikasa and the tree
Mikasa is currently having a nap next to the tree. She is having a dream, that Eren used nap here always and she would always wake him up ever since child. She slowly woke up, while looking sad, saying: 

"Eren..."
ONE LAST TIME. She is indeed missing him. Then she decided to standup, and look at the tree. She is having a lot of thoughts. However, after a while the thoughts have been cleared up. She to the tree and decided to knot the muffler Eren gave her on tree branch. Whilst she was knotting it, a dove suddenly flew and took the muffler using its beak. Mikasa was surprised, but in the end she accepted it as this might be fate, saying:

"You've come to take your muffler back. Eren..."

we follow the dove, seeing the dove flying around every part of Paradis, then it flew outside, where we see the beautiful azure sea, that's where the dove decided to drop the muffler to the sea.


we transition to the next scene.


# One FUCKING LAST SCENE 

# recommended music : gt20130218
This is just a scene where Eren, Mikasa, Armin where having fun as kids. Those were joyful moments.

"Come Armin, Mikasa."

Whether this is alternative timeline, where there are no titans, OR is just a past memory is up to your interpretation.
